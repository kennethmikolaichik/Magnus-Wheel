This is a project is centered around the idea of backspin creating lift. Much like a golf ball. The idea is to ramp this effect up as high as possible to create a new and novel approach to flight.

As a former Aircraft mechanic, I have studied flight mechanics extensively. I have found that engines are at near theoretical maximum efficiency and that there is a new approach needed to replace them. Rocket propulsion can only take us so far as this is highly dangerous and even after decades of advancement, rockets still explode uncontrollably around the world.

By becoming an expert in this form of lift, I intend to merge my research with existing airframe technology to increase the amount of lift achievable without increasing the amount of thrust required to achieve this lift. In other words, I intend to increase the lift to thrust ratio to a point previously unheard of.

Here is one of the most simple examples to build that I could find:

This effect is quite interesting to me for several reasons, the primary one being that the lift is being created purely by air passing over a rotating surface. Nothing else is required. Rotation also exhibits a few other effects such as...

Centripetal force & Centrifugal force:

"Centripetal force keeps an object moving in a circle and is always pointed toward the center of that circle. For instance, the gravitational force of the sun is a centripetal force that keeps the Earth orbiting around it."

Lastly, but not least! rotation is movement without distance. With rotation, an object can be said to be in motion without a translation of the object in 3D space. I believe this is significant, other types of motion do not exhibit this behavior.

Since all of the lift is happening at the boundary layer between the material and the air, I hypothesize that an increase in roughness of the material will increase lift. I also hypothesis that electrostatically charging the cylinder will increase lift. This will effectively increase the 'range' of the cylinder to a millimeter or more past its edge, it will make the cylinder’s diameter 'larger' without adding any extra mass. I intend to test these hypotheses with physical models.

Finally, it is my intention to remove the physical rotation of the cylinder and replace it with electrical / electrostatic manipulation wherein the air is persuaded to follow the cylinder’s surface. At this point I plan to move from a cylinder shape to a semicircle (longways cut cylinder) or perhaps a more typical elongated teardrop wing shape. In this configuration, added lift will be achieved through the electrostatic influence of the air. A larger column of air will be coerced into following an unnatural path over the upper section of the wing than a typical airfoil, thus creating more lift.
