This is a project created centered around the idea of backspin creating lift. Much like a golfball. The idea is to ramp this effect up as high as possible to create a new and novel approach to flight.

As a former Aircraft mechanic, I have studied flight mechanics extensively. I have found that engines are at near theoretical maximum efficiency and that there is a new approach needed to replace them. Rocket propulsion can only take us so far as this is highly dangerous and even after decades of advancement, rockets still explode uncontrollably around the world.

By becoming an expert in this form of lift, I intend to merge my research with existing airframe technology to increase the amount of lift achievable without increasing the amount of thrust required to achieve this lift. In other words, I intend to increase the lift to thrust ratio to a point previously unheard of.
